Create stunning and interactive timelines for your WordPress posts with ease. Post Timeline is the ultimate plugin for displaying your WordPress content in a visually appealing timeline format. Whether you want to showcase your blog history, company milestones, or any sequential content, Post Timeline offers a variety of customization options to fit your needs.

## üåü Description

Post Timeline is the WordPress Plugin that creates beautiful timeline pages for your WordPress posts. With this plugin, users can create unlimited vertical timelines and automatically generate animated scroll navigation based on tags or dates in ascending order.

**[üöÄ DEMO OF POST TIMELINE](https://posttimeline.com/)**

## ‚ú® Simple and Single Timeline

Use the shortcode `[post-timeline]` to create a Post Timeline on any page or post.

## üîÑ Multiple Timelines

To create multiple timelines, the admin needs to create multiple categories and assign posts to those categories. Then use the shortcode below:

`[post-timeline category="3"]`

Where `3` is the category ID. All the posts associated with Category ID `3` will appear with the above shortcode.  
**[How to Create Multiple Timelines](https://posttimeline.com/docs/how-to-create-multiple-timelines/)**

## üß≠ How Navigation Works?

Post Timeline Tags is an important tab of a timeline. Through this tab, admin users can create tags and associate their posts with those tags. Once all the posts are assigned to those tags, the Post Timeline will collect all the tags and use them in navigation.

**[Tags for Navigation](https://posttimeline.com/docs/post-timeline-tags/)**

## üìã Supports Custom Post Types

Post Timeline supports custom post types, making it versatile for a variety of content. To create a timeline for a custom post type, use the attribute `post-type` as shown below:

`[post-timeline post-type="custom_post_type"]`

Replace `custom_post_type` with your desired post type. This feature allows you to display not just regular posts, but any custom post types you've created, such as events, products, or portfolios.

For multiple post timelines, check the documentation. Feel free to create a ticket in case of any problem or bug.
